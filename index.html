<!-- *Assignment: JavaScript Contact List*

In this assignment, you're tasked with creating a JavaScript function that manages a contact list. Each contact in the list should have a full name, phone number, and email address. Here's the breakdown:

1. *Create a Contact Class:*
   - Design a Contact class with properties for fullName, phoneNumber, and emailAddress. The fullName property should automatically concatenate the first name and last name.

2. *Write a Function to Generate a Contact List:*
   - Develop a function, let's call it createContactList(), which initializes an empty array to store contacts.

3. *Add Contacts to the List:*
   - Inside the function, create at least two instances of the Contact class, each with unique information (e.g., first name, last name, phone number, email).

4. *Populate the Array:*
   - Add the created contacts to the array.

5. *Return the Contact List:*
   - Ensure the function returns the populated contact list array.

6. *Test Your Function:*
   - Outside the function, call createContactList() and store the result in a variable (e.g., myContactList).

7. *Console Log the Result:*
   - Use console.log() to display the contact list in the console. -->
